This work will feature a short collection of several known pcg algorithms in action. 
I will add the sources to the comments of the algorithms.

## Licence

You need Processing 3.1 or higher.


## Roadmap

Currently implemented a tilemap and a randomwalk algorithm. In the end there should be a multi layered map with realistic procedurally generated ground and pg objects.
