# processing-sketches
A collection of various processing sketches. Ideal as starting points or for code reuse.

##Installation Requirements
The sketches are collected in folders as categories. Read the readme files of each sketch for installation requirements. Some of the sketches need Processing 3.1 or higher, others require exlicit an older version (due to deprecated opengl imlementations).

You can copy this folder to the location of your standard processing sketch folder. The sketches will usually occur in your sketchbook list.
